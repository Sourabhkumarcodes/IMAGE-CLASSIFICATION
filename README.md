Image Classification: Vegetables and Fruits
This project uses machine learning to classify images of vegetables and fruits into different categories. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, and is trained on a dataset of labeled vegetable and fruit images.

Features
Multi-Class Classification: Classifies various types of fruits and vegetables.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Deep learning model architecture used for image classification.
Data Augmentation: Enhances the dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and zooms to prevent overfitting.
Accuracy Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.
Dataset
The dataset contains images of various fruits and vegetables, labeled according to their category. If you're using a publicly available dataset like the Fruits 360 Dataset, you can mention it here.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing training results and metrics.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or Keras
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
Model Performance
Include training and testing accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices to visualize the model performance.

Future Enhancements
Improve model accuracy by fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
Use transfer learning techniques for better classification.
Add support for more categories of fruits and vegetables.
